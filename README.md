# The Note Wall
An Amazon Alexa app that allows users to leave persistent notes for other members of their household by name. The app is based on the old [Skills SDK](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/deprecated). It makes use of DynamoDB.

You can find more setup instructions in the README of the repository linked above.
